# Neural network to predict

In this project, I'll build my neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.



```python
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Load and prepare the data

A critical step in working with neural networks is preparing the data correctly. Variables on different scales make it difficult for the network to efficiently learn the correct weights. Below, the code is written to load and prepare the data.


```python
data_path = 'Bike-Sharing-Dataset/hour.csv'

rides = pd.read_csv(data_path)
```


```python
rides.head()
```

## Checking out the data

This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the `cnt` column. You can see the first few rows of the data above.

Below is a plot showing the number of bike riders over the first 10 days in the data set. You can see the hourly rentals here. This data is pretty complicated! The weekends have lower over all ridership and there are spikes when people are biking to and from work during the week. Looking at the data above, we also have information about temperature, humidity, and windspeed, all of these likely affecting the number of riders. We'll be trying to capture all this with the model.


```python
rides[:24*10].plot(x='dteday', y='cnt')
```

### Dummy variables
Here we have some categorical variables like season, weather, month. To include these in our model, we'll need to make binary dummy variables. This is simple to do with Pandas thanks to `get_dummies()`.


```python
dummy_fields = ['season', 'weathersit', 'mnth', 'hr', 'weekday']
for each in dummy_fields:
    dummies = pd.get_dummies(rides[each], prefix=each, drop_first=False)
    rides = pd.concat([rides, dummies], axis=1)

fields_to_drop = ['instant', 'dteday', 'season', 'weathersit', 
                  'weekday', 'atemp', 'mnth', 'workingday', 'hr']
data = rides.drop(fields_to_drop, axis=1)
data.head()
```

### Scaling target variables
To make training the network easier, we'll standardize each of the continuous variables. That is, we'll shift and scale the variables such that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1.

The scaling factors are saved so we can go backwards when we use the network for predictions.


```python
quant_features = ['casual', 'registered', 'cnt', 'temp', 'hum', 'windspeed']
# Store scalings in a dictionary so we can convert back later
scaled_features = {}
for each in quant_features:
    mean, std = data[each].mean(), data[each].std()
    scaled_features[each] = [mean, std]
    data.loc[:, each] = (data[each] - mean)/std
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-1-1056739efe8e> in <module>()
          3 scaled_features = {}
          4 for each in quant_features:
    ----> 5     mean, std = data[each].mean(), data[each].std()
          6     scaled_features[each] = [mean, std]
          7     data.loc[:, each] = (data[each] - mean)/std


    NameError: name 'data' is not defined


### Splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets

We'll save the last 21 days of the data to use as a test set after we've trained the network. We'll use this set to make predictions and compare them with the actual number of riders.


```python
# Save the last 21 days 
test_data = data[-21*24:]
data = data[:-21*24]

# Separate the data into features and targets
target_fields = ['cnt', 'casual', 'registered']
features, targets = data.drop(target_fields, axis=1), data[target_fields]
test_features, test_targets = test_data.drop(target_fields, axis=1), test_data[target_fields]
```

We'll split the data into two sets, one for training and one for validating as the network is being trained. Since this is time series data, we'll train on historical data, then try to predict on future data (the validation set).


```python
# Hold out the last 60 days of the remaining data as a validation set
train_features, train_targets = features[:-60*24], targets[:-60*24]
val_features, val_targets = features[-60*24:], targets[-60*24:]
```

## Time to build the network

The network has two layers, a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation function is $f(x)=x$. A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes into account the threshold, is called an activation function. We work through each layer of our network calculating the outputs for each neuron. All of the outputs from one layer become inputs to the neurons on the next layer. This process is called *forward propagation*.

We use the weights to propagate signals forward from the input to the output layers in a neural network. We use the weights to also propagate error backwards from the output back into the network to update our weights. This is called *backpropagation*.


```python
class NeuralNetwork(object):
    def __init__(self, input_nodes, hidden_nodes, output_nodes, learning_rate):
        # Set number of nodes in input, hidden and output layers.
        self.input_nodes = input_nodes
        self.hidden_nodes = hidden_nodes
        self.output_nodes = output_nodes

        # Initialize weights
        self.weights_input_to_hidden = np.random.normal(0.0, self.hidden_nodes**-0.5, 
                                       (self.hidden_nodes, self.input_nodes))

        self.weights_hidden_to_output = np.random.normal(0.0, self.output_nodes**-0.5, 
                                       (self.output_nodes, self.hidden_nodes))
        self.lr = learning_rate
        
        # Activation function is the sigmoid function
        self.activation_function = lambda x: 1/(1+np.exp(-x))
    
    def train(self, inputs_list, targets_list):
        # Convert inputs list to 2d array
        inputs = np.array(inputs_list, ndmin=2).T
        targets = np.array(targets_list, ndmin=2).T

        ### Forward pass ###
        hidden_inputs = np.dot(self.weights_input_to_hidden,inputs)
        hidden_outputs = self.activation_function(hidden_inputs)# signals from hidden layer
        
        ### Output layer ###
        final_inputs = np.dot(self.weights_hidden_to_output,hidden_outputs)# signals into final output layer
        final_outputs = final_inputs # signals from final output layer
        
        ### Backward pass ###
        
        ### Output error ###
        output_errors = targets - final_outputs# Output layer error is the difference between desired target and actual output.
        
        ### Backpropagated error ###
        hidden_errors = np.dot(self.weights_hidden_to_output.T,output_errors)# errors propagated to the hidden layer
        hidden_grad = hidden_errors.T*hidden_outputs.T*(1-hidden_outputs.T)# hidden layer gradients
        
        ### Weights with gradient descent step ###
        self.weights_hidden_to_output += self.lr*output_errors*hidden_outputs.T# update hidden-to-output weights with gradient descent step
        self.weights_input_to_hidden += self.lr *np.dot(hidden_grad.T,inputs.T)# update input-to-hidden 
        
    def run(self, inputs_list):
        # Run a forward pass through the network
        inputs = np.array(inputs_list, ndmin=2).T
        
        # Hidden layer
        hidden_inputs = np.dot(self.weights_input_to_hidden,inputs)# signals into hidden layer
        hidden_outputs = self.activation_function(hidden_inputs)# signals from hidden layer
        
        # Output layer
        final_inputs = np.dot(self.weights_hidden_to_output,hidden_outputs)# signals into final output layer
        final_outputs = final_inputs# signals from final output layer 
        
        return final_outputs
```


```python
def MSE(y, Y):
    return np.mean((y-Y)**2)
```

## Training the network

Here we'll set the hyperparameters for the network. The strategy here is to find hyperparameters such that the error on the training set is low, but we're not overfitting to the data. If we train the network too long or have too many hidden nodes, it can become overly specific to the training set and will fail to generalize to the validation set. That is, the loss on the validation set will start increasing as the training set loss drops.

We also are using a method know as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to train the network. The idea is that for each training pass, we grab a random sample of the data instead of using the whole data set. We use many more training passes than with normal gradient descent, but each pass is much faster. This ends up training the network more efficiently.

### Choose the number of epochs
This is the number of times the dataset will pass through the network, each time updating the weights. As the number of epochs increases, the network becomes better and better at predicting the targets in the training set. We need to choose enough epochs to train the network well but not too many or we are overfitting.

### Choose the learning rate
This scales the size of weight updates. If this is too big, the weights tend to explode and the network fails to fit the data. Note that the lower the learning rate, the smaller the steps are in the weight updates and the longer it takes for the neural network to converge.

### Choose the number of hidden nodes
The more hidden nodes we have, the more accurate predictions the model will make. We can look at the losses dictionary for a metric of the network performance. If the number of hidden units is too low, then the model won't have enough space to learn and if it is too high there are too many options for the direction that the learning can take.


```python
import sys

### Set the hyperparameters here ###
epochs = 1200
learning_rate = 0.02
hidden_nodes = 25
output_nodes = 1

N_i = train_features.shape[1]
network = NeuralNetwork(N_i, hidden_nodes, output_nodes, learning_rate)


losses = {'train':[], 'validation':[]}
for e in range(epochs):
    # Go through a random batch of 128 records from the training data set
    batch = np.random.choice(train_features.index, size=128)
    for record, target in zip(train_features.ix[batch].values, 
                              train_targets.ix[batch]['cnt']):
        network.train(record, target)
    
    # Printing out the training progress
    train_loss = MSE(network.run(train_features), train_targets['cnt'].values)
    val_loss = MSE(network.run(val_features), val_targets['cnt'].values)
    sys.stdout.write("\rProgress: " + str(100 * e/float(epochs))[:4] \
                     + "% ... Training loss: " + str(train_loss)[:5] \
                     + " ... Validation loss: " + str(val_loss)[:5])
    
    losses['train'].append(train_loss)
    losses['validation'].append(val_loss)

```

    Progress: 99.9% ... Training loss: 0.055 ... Validation loss: 0.167


```python
plt.plot(losses['train'], label='Training loss')
plt.plot(losses['validation'], label='Validation loss')
plt.legend()
plt.ylim(ymax=0.5)
```

## Check out our predictions

Here, we use the test data to view how well our network is modeling the data.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,4))

mean, std = scaled_features['cnt']
predictions = network.run(test_features)*std + mean
ax.plot(predictions[0], label='Prediction')
ax.plot((test_targets['cnt']*std + mean).values, label='Data')
ax.set_xlim(right=len(predictions))
ax.legend()

dates = pd.to_datetime(rides.ix[test_data.index]['dteday'])
dates = dates.apply(lambda d: d.strftime('%b %d'))
ax.set_xticks(np.arange(len(dates))[12::24])
_ = ax.set_xticklabels(dates[12::24], rotation=45)
```

## Thinking about the results
 
The model predicts well up to 20th of the month. After it starts failing since Xmas and New Year approach after that date. If we look at the previous year, usage during the same period was higher than the current year. Since we have only data for one year for training, it is expected to have slight difference between prediction and actual data
